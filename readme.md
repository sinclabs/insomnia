# Insomnia

Insomnia is a VR environment built with A-Frame. The site is deployed at [insomnia.subbu.dev](insomnia.subbu.dev). This is still largely work in progress.

## Development
Make sure you have `git` and `Node.JS` installed

- To get started, clone the repo: 
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:sinclabs/insomnia.git
```
- Install the dependencies: 
```bash
    npm i
```
- Build the source: 
```bash
    npm run build
```
- Start the local server: 
```bash
    npm start
```

*Note:* To view the local deployment in your VR headset's browser, you'll need to host the site over HTTPS, as it is a WebVR requirement.
